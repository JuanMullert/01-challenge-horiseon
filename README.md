# Code refactoring


In this Challenge I'm given a finished code which I modified to the standards of a screen reader or search engines.

Essentially I replace the non-semantic elements to semantic elements to give a better context to the project.

To impress clients, you should always exceed expectations and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, check that all links are functioning correctly. You can also increase the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
